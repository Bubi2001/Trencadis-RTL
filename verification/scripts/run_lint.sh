# ## This script finds all SystemVerilog source files in the 'rtl/' directory
# ## and runs Verilator in lint-only mode to check for syntax and style issues.
# ## It is designed to be called from the Makefile or a CI workflow.

# Exit immediately if any command fails. This is crucial for CI.

# --- Configuration ---
# Define all directories containing RTL modules that might be instantiated.
# This ensures Verilator can find any submodule referenced in your code.
# Recursively find all subdirectories under rtl/ and add them as include paths
INCLUDE_PATHS=$(find rtl/ -type d -exec printf " -I%s" {} \;)

# --- Main Loop ---
# Find all SystemVerilog files in the rtl directory and check them one by one.
# The -print0 and IFS=... part ensures that this works even if you have
# filenames with spaces (which you shouldn't, but it's robust).

  # The script will exit here with an error if Verilator finds any issues.
