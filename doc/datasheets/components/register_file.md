# Datasheet: register_file

Version: v1.0.0

Last Updated: 2025-08-04

## 1. Overview

The `register_file` is a flexible, synthesizable SystemVerilog module that implements a high-performance register file with one synchronous write port and a parameterizable number of asynchronous read ports. It is designed to be a core component in processor designs, particularly those requiring concurrent data access, such as in the execution stage of a pipelined CPU. Key features include a configurable register count and data width, and an optional mode to enforce that register 0 is hardwired to zero, making it directly compatible with the RISC-V integer instruction set architecture (ISA).

## 2. Features

* Single, synchronous write port.
* Parameterizable number of asynchronous read ports.
* Parameterizable register count (`REG_COUNT`) and data width (`DEPTH`).
* Optional RISC-V compatible zero-register functionality (register at address 0 is always zero).
* Fully synchronous design with a single clock domain for writes.
* Active-low asynchronous reset to initialize all registers to zero.
* Standard "read-before-write" behavior for simultaneous read/write to the same address.

## 3. Block Diagram

*(A conceptual block diagram is shown below. The number of read ports is determined by the `NUM_READ_PORTS` parameter.)*

## 6. Functional Description

The `register_file_parametric` module provides a simple and efficient memory structure commonly used in CPUs. Its operation is divided into three main functions: write, read, and reset.

### Write Operation

A write operation is performed when the `wen` (write enable) signal is asserted high. On the next rising edge of `clk`, the data present on the `wdata` bus is written into the register selected by the `waddr` bus. The write is synchronous.

If the `ZERO_REG_IS_ZERO` parameter is set to `1`, any attempt to write to address `0` (`waddr == '0`) will be ignored, and the contents of register 0 will remain zero.

### Read Operation

Read operations are asynchronous (combinatorial). The module supports `NUM_READ_PORTS` concurrent reads. For each read port `i`, the address on `raddr[i]` is used to select a register. The contents of that register are then immediately presented on the corresponding `rdata[i]` output bus.

If a read and a write occur to the same address in the same clock cycle, the read port will output the *old* data stored in the register before the write completes. This is standard "read-before-write" behavior.

If the `ZERO_REG_IS_ZERO` parameter is set to `1`, any read from address `0` (`raddr[i] == '0`) will result in `rdata[i]` being driven to all zeros, regardless of the physical value stored in register 0.

### Reset

The module uses an active-low asynchronous reset (`rst_n`). When `rst_n` is pulled low, all physical registers within the file are immediately and asynchronously set to zero.
